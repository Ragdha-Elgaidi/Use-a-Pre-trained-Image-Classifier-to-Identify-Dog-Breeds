# **Use-a-Pre-trained-Image-Classifier-to-Identify-Dog-Breeds**
It's apart of my nanodegree program "**AI Programming with Python**"
## **Principal Objectives:**
   1- Correctly identify which pet images are of dogs (even if the breed is misclassified) and which pet images aren't of dogs.

   2-Correctly classify the breed of dog, for the images that are of dogs.    

   3-Determine which CNN model architecture (ResNet, AlexNet, or VGG), "best" achieve objectives 1 and 2.

   4-Consider the time resources required to best achieve objectives 1 and 2, and determine if an alternative solution would have given a "good enough" result, given the amount of time each of the algorithms takes to run.
## **Program Outline:**

   -Time your program
        Use Time Module to compute program runtime
   -Get program Inputs from the user
        Use command line arguments to get user inputs
   -Create Pet Images Labels
        Use the pet images filenames to create labels
        Store the pet image labels in a data structure (e.g. dictionary)
   -Create Classifier Labels and Compare Labels
        Use the Classifier function to classify the images and create the classifier labels
        Compare Classifier Labels to Pet Image Labels
        Store Pet Labels, Classifier Labels, and their comparison in a complex data structure (e.g. dictionary of lists)
   -Classifying Labels as "Dogs" or "Not Dogs"
        Classify all Labels as "Dogs" or "Not Dogs" using dognames.txt file
        Store new classifications in the complex data structure (e.g. dictionary of lists)
   -Calculate the Results
        Use Labels and their classifications to determine how well the algorithm worked on classifying images
   - Print the Results
