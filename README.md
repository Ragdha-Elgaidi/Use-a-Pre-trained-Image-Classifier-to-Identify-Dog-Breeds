# **Use-a-Pre-trained-Image-Classifier-to-Identify-Dog-Breeds**
It's apart of my nanodegree program "**AI Programming with Python**"
## **Principal Objectives**
   1- Correctly identify which pet images are of dogs (even if the breed is misclassified) and which pet images aren't of dogs.

   2-Correctly classify the breed of dog, for the images that are of dogs.    

   3-Determine which CNN model architecture (ResNet, AlexNet, or VGG), "best" achieve objectives 1 and 2.

   4-Consider the time resources required to best achieve objectives 1 and 2, and determine if an alternative solution would have given a "good enough" result, given the amount of time each of the algorithms takes to run.
